# Siemens-TIA-Automated-Factory
Part 1 : Automated Sorting &amp; Machining Line


# Automated Sorting & Machining Line Simulation

## Project Objective
This project simulates an industrial production line using Siemens TIA Portal and Factory I/O. The system automatically sorts three different types of raw materials (Blue, Green, Metal) onto dedicated conveyor lines for parallel CNC machining.

## Demonstration
**(This is the most important part!)** Record a short video or create a GIF of your simulation working and put it here. It's very powerful.

## üõ†Ô∏è Toolkit
* **PLC:** Siemens S7-1200 (simulated with PLCSIM)
* **IDE:** Siemens TIA Portal v19
* **Simulation:** Factory I/O

## üîå I/O Mapping
Here is the mapping between the Factory I/O sensors/actuators and the PLC tags.

**(Embed the screenshot of your I/O map here!)**

## üöÄ How to Run
1.  Download the `.zap19` file and restore it in TIA Portal v19.
2.  Download the `.factoryio` file and open it in Factory I/O.
3.  Start the PLCSIM simulation in TIA Portal.
4.  In Factory I/O, select the "Siemens S7-PLCSIM" driver and connect.
