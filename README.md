# Siemens-TIA-Automated-Factory

# Automated Sorting, Machining, Assemblying and Packing Simulation

A fully simulated discrete manufacturing line built with Siemens TIA Portal (v19), PLCSIM, and Factory I/O.  
The virtual plant performs a complete mini production workflow:
1. Infeed & Identification (color / material based)
2. Sorting to dedicated buffers
3. Machining (e.g., drilling / surface treatment placeholder)
4. Assembly (pairing / combining parts logic)
5. Quality Gate (basic presence / type validation)
6. Packing / Palletizing (batch-based release)

## üéØ Project Objective

Demonstrate an educational yet industry-relevant control solution that:
* Integrates multiple functional cells under one PLC program architecture.
* Uses modular, reusable, and state-driven logic blocks.
* Simulates a part lifecycle from raw material arrival to finished packed unit.
* Provides a foundation for later optimization (OEE, traceability, recipe control).

## üß± System Overview

| Cell | Function | Key Actions | Core Signals (Examples) |
|------|----------|-------------|--------------------------|
| Infeed & Detection | Accept raw parts | Presence detect, color scan | Part_Present, Color_Blue/Green, Metal_Flag |
| Sorting Diverter | Route parts | Diverter left/center/right | Diverter_CMD, Jam_Sensor |
| Machining Station | Process parts | Clamp, spindle | Clamp_Cyl, Spindle_Run, Cycle_Done |
| Assembly Cell | Combine items | Pick/Place | Asm_Part_A_Ready, Asm_Part_B_Ready |
| Packing / Palletizing | Batch & release | Counter, eject | Pack_Count, Batch_Done | (To be continuned..)

---

## üîÑ Process Flow (High-Level)

1. Raw part enters via conveyor.
2. Sensor cluster classifies (color).
3. Send according to material type (Blue Green Red).
4. When machining station is free and buffer has stock ‚Üí transfer part.
5. Machining cycle executes (simulate with timers / step sequence).
6. Machined part(product base) + complementary component (Product lid) assembled.
7. Assembled unit passes for packaging.

## üß¨ State Machine Example (Machining)

States (ENUM):
0 Idle  
1 WaitPart  
2 Clamp  
3 Process  
4 Unclamp  
5 Unload  
6 Complete (one-shot to upstream)  

Transition logic uses positive edges and condition guards (e.g., Part_Present AND Station_Free). Timers (TON) simulate cycle durations.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Example Tag Naming Convention

Prefixing:
* I_: Inputs (I_Conv_Infeed_Sensor)
* Q_: Outputs (Q_Diverter_Left)
* M_: Internal memory flags (M_Part_Latched)
* DB/Struct-based recommended alternative: gIO.Infeed.Sensor, gCtrl.Sorter.Enable

Consistency improves readability and reuse.

## üîå I/O Mapping

Embed or recreate a table or screenshot mapping Factory I/O elements to PLC addresses.

Example (placeholder):

| Function | Factory I/O Element | PLC Address | Tag |
|----------|--------------------|-------------|-----|
| Infeed Photoeye | Sensor_1 | I0.0 | I_Infeed_PE |
| Color Sensor Blue | Sensor_2 | I0.1 | I_Color_Blue |
| Diverter Left Solenoid | Act_1 | Q0.0 | Q_Div_Left |
| Diverter Right Solenoid | Act_2 | Q0.1 | Q_Div_Right |
| Machining Clamp | Act_3 | Q0.2 | Q_Clamp |
| Spindle Motor | Act_4 | Q0.3 | Q_Spindle |
| QA Reject Pusher | Act_5 | Q0.4 | Q_Reject |

(Replace with actual tags; ensure alignment with the TIA project.)

## üß™ Quality Gate Logic (Sample Pseudocode)

IF (Assembled_Unit = TRUE) THEN  
  IF (ColorType = BLUE AND Machined = TRUE) OR (ColorType = METAL) THEN  
    QA_OK := TRUE;  
  ELSE  
    QA_Fail := TRUE;  
  END_IF;  
END_IF;

---

## üì¶ Packing Logic

Batch_Size configurable (e.g., 10).  
On each QA_OK rising edge ‚Üí Increment Pack_Count.  
IF Pack_Count >= Batch_Size THEN  
  Batch_Done := TRUE (one-shot)  
  Pack_Count := 0  
END_IF

Future extension: Pallet layers, recipe-driven batch sizes.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety & Interlocks (Simulation-Oriented)

Basic (soft) checks:
* Jam detection (no movement while motor command active N seconds).  
* Diverter mutual exclusion (never energize Left & Right simultaneously).  
* Machining cannot start unless Clamp confirmed & Part_Present.  
* Assembly cannot proceed unless both required part flags set.  

Optional: Aggregate alarm bit to inhibit new cycle start.

---

## üßæ KPIs (Extend Later)

Potential metrics to log in DB_Stats:
* Parts_Infeed_Total
* Machined_OK
* Assembled_OK
* QA_Fail_Count
* Packaged_Units
* MTBF / MTTR placeholders (manual resets)

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Toolkit

* PLC: Siemens S7-1200 (simulated with PLCSIM)
* IDE: Siemens TIA Portal v19
* Simulation: Factory I/O (Driver: Siemens S7-PLCSIM)
* (Optional) HMI: Basic panel or WinCC Comfort screen for status & KPIs

---

## üöÄ How to Run

1. Restore the provided .zap19 project in TIA Portal v19.
2. Open and compile; ensure hardware configuration matches S7-1200 (simulation ok).
3. Start PLCSIM and load the program.
4. Open the .factoryio scene file in Factory I/O.
5. Configure driver: Siemens S7-PLCSIM ‚Üí Set IP (usually 127.0.0.1) & Rack/Slot (e.g., Rack 0 Slot 1 for S7-1200 CPU).
6. Start simulation; verify I/O bits toggle correctly (test a sensor).
7. Enable Master Start (e.g., HMI or M_Bit) ‚Üí Observe flow.
8. Use Watch Table / Trace to monitor key tags: Part counters, State enums, Diverter commands.

## üß™ Testing Checklist

| Test | Action | Expected |
|------|--------|----------|
| Infeed Detection | Place part at entry | I_Infeed_PE = 1 |
| Sorting | Cycle 3 different types | Diverter routes each correctly |
| Buffer Full | Simulate backlog | Buffer_Full bit prevents further route |
| Machining | Force Part Present | State machine steps through sequence |
| Assembly | Provide both components | Assembled flag pulses |
| QA Reject | Use wrong combo (simulate) | QA_Fail increments |
| Batch Complete | Run N good units | Batch_Done one-shot |

---

## üß© Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Possible Cause | Resolution |
|---------|----------------|-----------|
| No PLC connection | Driver misconfigured | Recheck IP / Rack / Slot |
| Diverter inactive | Interlock active | Check both sides not commanded simultaneously |
| Machining stuck in WaitPart | Buffer empty flag | Confirm buffer release logic |
| Assembly never starts | Component flags false | Trace upstream handshake bits |
| Batch never completes | Pack_Count not incrementing | Confirm QA_OK edge detection |

---

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

* Add RFID / ID-based serialization.
* Introduce recipe management (different machining times).
* Implement OEE dashboard (Availability, Performance, Quality).
* Add fault injection panel (simulate sensor failure).
* Use SCL for cleaner sequence code (currently LAD/FBD assumed).
* OPC UA link for external MES integration.

## ‚ùì FAQ

Q: Can I use S7-1500 instead?  
A: Yes‚Äîadjust hardware configuration and (if needed) address changes.

Q: Can this run on a physical conveyor cell?  
A: Core logic yes; adapt I/O, safety circuits, and add hardware interlocks.

Q: Why are some steps timers instead of sensor-driven?  
A: In simulation we often abstract physical cycle completion; replace with actual sensors when migrating.

## üìé Notes

The word "Assemblying" in the subtitle is retained for continuity, but ‚ÄúAssembling‚Äù is the standard spelling.
