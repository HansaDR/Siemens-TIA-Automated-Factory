# Siemens-TIA-Automated-Factory

# Automated Sorting, Machining, Assembling and Packing Simulation

A fully simulated discrete manufacturing line built with Siemens TIA Portal (v19), PLCSIM, and Factory I/O.  
This project now includes completed palletizer and overhead crane subsystems (see demo link below). The virtual plant performs a complete mini production workflow:
1. Infeed & Identification (color / material based)
2. Sorting to dedicated buffers
3. Machining (e.g., drilling / lid production)
4. Pick & Place / Assembly (pairing product base with product lid)
5. Quality Gate (presence / type validation)
6. Packing / Palletizing (batch-based release)
7. Pallet handling with Palletizer and Overhead Crane (pallet transport / staging)

## üéØ Project Objective

Demonstrate an educational yet industry-relevant control solution that:
* Integrates multiple functional cells (sorting, machining, pick & place, assembly, inspection, palletizing, crane handling) under one PLC program architecture.
* Uses modular, reusable, and state-driven logic blocks.
* Simulates a product lifecycle from raw material arrival to packaged and palletized units.
* Provides a base for OEE, traceability, recipe control, and integration with MES.

## üîÑ Process Flow (High-Level, updated)

1. Raw parts enter via infeed conveyor and are classified (Blue / Green / Metal).
2. Parts are sorted to dedicated buffers or routed to machining centers.
3. Machining centers produce machined bases and/or lids.
4. Pick & Place robots collect components and deliver them to assembly stations.
5. Assembly combines base + lid; QA gate validates the unit.
6. Valid units accumulate into batches; packing forms boxes or pallet loads.
7. Palletizer places packages on pallets and secures (clamp/strap simulation).
8. Overhead crane moves completed pallets to storage or shipping staging area.
9. System logs KPI events and errors to DB_Stats for later analysis.

## üß¨ Palletizer & Crane: Functional Summary

Palletizer:
* Accepts boxes from packing conveyor.
* Accumulates boxes according to pallet pattern (rows / columns).
* Controls pallet magazine (present / clamp / raise / lower).
* Outputs: Pallet_Ready, Pallet_Full, Pallet_Clamp, Pallet_Raise
* Handshake with Crane: Pallet_ReadyForPick ‚Üí Crane picks up pallet.

Overhead Crane:
* Receives pallet pickup requests from Palletizer or operator.
* Moves along X/Y rails to pick & place pallet positions.
* Includes lift/lower and clamp/unclamp actions.
* Interlocks: speed limits, no-motion during adjacent cell active if configured.
* Outputs: Crane_Position, Crane_Busy, Crane_Error

Suggested tags (examples ‚Äî map to actual %I/%Q addresses in Tags.pdf):
* PAL_Present, PAL_ClampCmd, PAL_RaiseCmd, PAL_PalletID
* CRN_XCmd, CRN_YCmd, CRN_LiftCmd, CRN_ClampCmd, CRN_Status

---

## üß¨ State Machine Example (Palletizer)

States:
0 Idle  
1 WaitForBox  
2 PlaceBoxRow  
3 AdvancePattern  
4 FullPalletPrepare  
5 SignalCranePickup  
6 Complete / Reset

Transitions triggered by box arrival, pattern index, pallet sensors and crane handshake.

---

## üîå I/O Mapping

Be sure to update the I/O mapping PDF/files to include:
* Palletizer sensors & actuators
* Crane travel axes, lift, clamp feedback
* Any new safety edges (light curtains / crane zone sensors)

Example mapping should appear in `docs/pdf/tags-io-mapping.pdf` (suggested) or the existing Tags.pdf.

---

## üß™ Quality Gate & Packing Logic (Reminder)

Quality gate and packing logic remain the same, with the addition that Packed units are forwarded to the Palletizer. The packing system should emit a Palletizer_Request when enough packages are ready to start a pallet pattern.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Toolkit

* PLC: Siemens S7-1200 (PLCSIM) or S7-1500 if you migrate
* IDE: Siemens TIA Portal v19
* Simulation: Factory I/O (Siemens S7-PLCSIM driver)
* Optional: WinCC HMI for operational control & KPI screens

---

## üöÄ How to Run (Updated)

1. Restore the `.zap19` project in TIA Portal v19 (ensure all FBs/DBs imported).
2. Compile & load to PLCSIM (check CPU selection).
3. Open the `.factoryio` scene and start Factory I/O.
4. Set driver: Siemens S7-PLCSIM (127.0.0.1), verify Rack/Slot.
5. Confirm new I/O bits for palletizer & crane respond in the driver panel.
6. Start simulation and enable master start.
7. Watch tags: PACK_Count, PAL_State, CRN_Status, QA_OK, MC[n].State.
8. Use the demo YouTube link above to compare expected behavior.
